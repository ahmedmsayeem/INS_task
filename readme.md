# **Secure Key Management System (KMS) Implementation**

## **1. Overview**

This document details the design and implementation of a Secure Key Management System (KMS) built to manage both symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic keys. The system addresses critical security requirements, including:

*   Centralized key distribution for symmetric encryption (AES).
*   Simulation of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for asymmetric encryption (RSA).
*   Secure key generation and storage using industry-standard cryptographic libraries.
*   Secure key exchange using Diffie-Hellman (DH) to ensure forward secrecy.
*   Key revocation mechanisms to mitigate the impact of key compromise.

The primary goal is to provide a robust framework for generating, storing, and distributing cryptographic keys securely, while mitigating common threats such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and key exposure.

## **2. Key Features**

The KMS implementation encompasses the following features:

*   **Symmetric Encryption (AES):**
    *   256-bit AES key generation using `os.urandom(32)`.
    *   AES encryption in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding for block alignment.
*   **Asymmetric Encryption (RSA):**
    *   2048-bit RSA key pair generation for each simulated user.
    *   Encryption and decryption utilizing PKCS1v15 padding.
*   **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:**
    *   Generation of ephemeral DH parameters to derive shared session keys.
*   **Key Revocation:**
    *   Mechanism to remove compromised keys from the system's storage.

## **3. System Architecture**

The KMS architecture comprises the following core components:

1.  **Symmetric Key Management:**

    *   Utilizes AES-256 for symmetric encryption operations.
    *   Centralized key storage within an in-memory dictionary (for demonstration purposes).
2.  **Asymmetric Key Management (PKI Simulation):**

    *   Employs RSA-2048 for asymmetric encryption and decryption.
    *   RSA key pairs (public/private) are generated and stored within a simulated PKI repository.
3.  **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:**

    *   DH key exchange generates ephemeral session keys, ensuring forward secrecy.
4.  **Key Revocation:**

    *   Keys can be deleted from the system upon detection of a compromise.

## **4. Code Implementation**

### **4.1. Code Structure**

The system's implementation is structured as follows:

*   **SecureKeyManagementSystem Class:**
    *   `generate_aes_key()`: Generates AES keys.
    *   `generate_rsa_key_pair()`: Generates RSA key pairs.
    *   `encrypt_with_aes()`, `decrypt_with_aes()`: Methods for AES encryption/decryption.
    *   `encrypt_with_rsa()`, `decrypt_with_rsa()`: Methods for RSA encryption/decryption.
    *   `generate_diffie_hellman_key()`: Generates DH keys.
    *   `key_revocation()`: Implements key revocation.
*   **Test Cases:**

    *   Comprehensive test suite demonstrating the management of symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and key revocation.

### **4.2. Libraries and Tools**

The following libraries were utilized:

*   `cryptography` (Python library): For AES, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman operations.
*   `os`: For secure random byte generation (`os.urandom`).
*   `base64`: For encoding binary data to text and vice versa.

### **4.3. Code Repository**

The Python code is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/ahmedmsayeem/INS\_task](https://github.com/ahmedmsayeem/INS_task)

### **4.4. Execution**

To run the KMS:

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ahmedmsayeem/INS_task
    cd INS_task
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    ```
3.  Execute the main Python file:

    ```bash
    python secure_key_mgmt.py
    ```

    This will execute the test suite to demonstrate KMS functionality.

## **5. Security Considerations**

The following security considerations are addressed:

*   **Mitigating MITM Attacks:**

    *   The simulated PKI utilizes RSA key pairs. A production environment would integrate a Certificate Authority (CA) and use TLS/SSL for secure communication.
*   **Ensuring Forward Secrecy:**

    *   Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman keys ensure that past communications remain secure even if long-term keys are compromised.
*   **Key Revocation and Compromise Mitigation:**

    *   The key revocation mechanism enables the deletion of keys if they are compromised, reducing the risk of unauthorized data access. Centralized storage simplifies key management and revocation.

## **6. Test Results**

The following test cases were executed:

1.  **Symmetric Key Management (AES):** Successful encryption and decryption of text.
2.  **Asymmetric Key Management (RSA):** Successful encryption and decryption of text.
3.  **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:** Generation of valid ephemeral public keys.
4.  **Key Revocation Test:** Successful deletion of compromised keys from storage.
5.  **Decryption After Revocation:** Confirmed decryption failure after key revocation.

## **7. Conclusion**

This Secure Key Management System demonstrates the secure generation, storage, and exchange of cryptographic keys, incorporating industry-standard practices and cryptographic libraries. While this implementation is a simplified representation of a full PKI, it provides a foundational framework for further development and integration with secure transport protocols and certificate management systems.
